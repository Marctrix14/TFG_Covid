The dataset is splitted as:
train -> 992 cases* (446 normal, 446 effusion)
valid -> 100 cases (50 normal, 50 effusion)
test -> 18 cases(9 normal, 9 effusion)

* each case is a folder that contains two images, one of the grid for the left lung (E3_flipped.png) and another of the grid for the right lung (D3.png)

The grid for the left lung is flipped so that all grids are oriented the same way and the classification of "effusion" becomes more reliable

Total ims: 1100 ims
